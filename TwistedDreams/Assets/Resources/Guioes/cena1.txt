Wait... Why am i seeing myself? It's so weird...
C
Hey, Sarah!
PP
What? Who are you? And where are you?
C
I'm here, silly!
PP
I am not understanding...
C
You are seeing the world through my eyes.
PP
Ok... But why?
PP
And even more important,
PP
WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN MY BEDROOM?
C
Calm Down. Don't yell at me. I'm here to help you.
PP
Help me? I don't need your help. With nothing at all.
C
And that's where you're wrong.
C
Don't you want to get out of here?
C
You'll need my help to do so.
PP
What are you talking about? This is my home!
PP
The one who needs to leave it's you! Now!
C
Well, you see... That would be... kind of hard.
PP
How did you come here in the first place then?
C
I don't know. Do you always remember the beginning of your dreams?
PP
Dreams? Now it makes sense.
PP
I'm dreaming, that's why I'm seeing myself through your eyes.
PP
Also, that explains why you ARE IN MY BEDROOM WITHOUT MY PERMISSION!
C
Wow, easy there. Do you think I want to be here?
C
I want to wake up as much as you do.
C
But for that, we need to cooperate. We will need each others help to leave this place.
PP
I don't need your help. I just have to wake up, and that will happen at any moment.
PP
But for now, I just don’t want to be with someone ... 
PP
... with obvious privacy boundaries issues. Goodbye.
