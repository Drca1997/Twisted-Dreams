SARAH
Damn... Now what?
???
Yeah, this is the scariest part. I don't know.
SARAH
You said that the only way to make this stop is for me... you... 
SARAH
...us, to forgive ourselves, to stop blaming ourselves for the accident.
???
Yeah, but like, that's easier said than done.
SARAH
Indeed. But do you prefer to be trapped in this dream forever?
???
At least here, I have the chance to try to stop the accident from happening. Make things right.
SARAH
How's that working out so far?
???
Well, not good, but that's your fault, you keep pressing E for too long.
SARAH
...
SARAH
You don't really think that preventing the accident here in the dream will change the past, do you?
???
Of course not. But at least, I'll finally have some peace, knowing that I did all I can do to make things right.
SARAH
If that's your way to cope with it, well, ok. So, what do you want to do?
