SARAH
NO, I won't let it happen!
???
It already did, Sarah. You can't change the past.
SARAH
But..but.. Wasn't this why you wanted me to come here? To stop it from happening?
???
No, Sarah. I made you come here to give you an opportunity to make peace with yourself.
SARAH
I don't understand.
???
You have to stop blaming yourself for what happened.
???
The only way to move forward is for you to let go off the past.
