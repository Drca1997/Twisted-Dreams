See? Why do you always have to be so stubborn? Now what? What do you do? Go around blindly, stumbling into everything?
Sarah
F**k off! Leave me alone!

Listen, Sarah. I am not your enemy. Really.

I've been trying to tell you this since the beggining.

In fact, we need to work together to get out of here.

Here, let me help you.

I'm going to call you. Just follow the sound of your phone and you will find your way out of the house.
???
... Eventually.
