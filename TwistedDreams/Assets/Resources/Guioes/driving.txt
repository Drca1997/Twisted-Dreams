So, now we just have to go through this florest to reach our destination.
SARAH
Where are we heading?
???
I told you already: We are leaving this dream.
???
Do you see that big blue cilinder over there? It means that you have to drive towards it.
???
After you reach it, it will disapear and another one will appear further ahead.
???
Just follow the cilinders and you will reach the end of the forest.
SARAH
Wow, looks like a car racing videogame, with checkpoints!
???
Yeah... Sort of.
SARAH
I don't know why, but this car looks so familiar...
???
Be careful to not to crash it again.
SARAH
What do you mean "again"?
???
Nevermind, my mistake. Now, let's go!
