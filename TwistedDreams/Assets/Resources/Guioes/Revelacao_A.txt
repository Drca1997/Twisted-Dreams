SARAH

???
You and your stepfather, John, were driving home after some a one-weekend vacations. 
???
You always saw John as some kind of bitter enemy. All he wanted was to be accepted by you.
???
But you, as stubborn as you are, you never did. You always thought he was trying to replace your late father...
???
... and never recognized him as the friend he was trying to be.
???
So, your mother tought that weekend spent with him would change your mind.
???
And as usual, you started a fight with him.
???
Did no one ever tell you to not distract the one at the wheel?
???
So, yeah, this happens: the car goes off a cliff.
???
John died.
???
You were terribly injured.
???
So, since that day, you relieve that moment over and over again, in this nightmare.
???
And I guess the only way to make it stop, is for you to overcome your guilt and find inner peace.
???
Any questions so far, kid?
SARAH
I... I don't know what to say.
???
Yeah, take your time to process all of this.
SARAH
So, how injured I was.. or am?
???
Yeah, about that...
???
So, do you see me in a wheelchair?
SARAH
Oh god, no.
???
Yeah...
SARAH
You are me. You are in my mind. That's why I am seeing through your eyes.
???
You're kinda right. Except it is the total opposite situation. You are me.
SARAH
What? What do you mean?
???
You are not real, Sarah. You're just a figment of my imagination. 
???
I created you because... I guess, I couldn't go through all of this alone.
???
But the only person who could understand me was myself.
